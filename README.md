Required Packages

- VRCSDK 3 [any version]

- Udon Sharp v1.0 

- [If you are using an earlier version of Udon Sharp i.e. V0.2x please use V1.32 which is in the pre EAC folder when downloading]

- If you'd like to use Audio Link/DMX you must import both Audio Link and VRSL Stage Lights

This video player is designed to be used in clubs and compatible with the service VRCDN! It works with both PC & Quest users, taking advantage of a multi-url feature to bring best performance to both platforms.

** NOTE Quest does not support Youtube. You must use a link resolver service like Jinnai when the service is working. Twitch is also not supported so I personally use VRCDN for streams I want for Quest players to use. These limitations can be read in VRChat's documentation

Just drag and drop the prefab into your scene! Type in the link you want for PC and the link you want for Quest then hit play. Bada-bing-bada-boom! If you'd like any help please join my server and fill out a ticket :D
